# 11ty-boilerplate

My own little 11ty starter project. Based off https://css-tricks.com/eleventy-starter-with-tailwind-css-alpine-js/

Includes:
- Tailwind CSS
- AlpineJS
- Uses Nunjucks for layouts and partials, HTML for pages
- Netlify-ready
- HTML and CSS is minified on build, and _site is deleted
